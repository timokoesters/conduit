## üöÄ Get started

You can find all the details on how to set up and manage your Conduit server in the **[Documentation](https://conduit-docs.surge.sh)**

## ‚ùî FAQ

<details open>
<summary>What is the goal?</summary>

An efficient Matrix homeserver that's easy to set up and just works. You can install
it on a mini-computer like the Raspberry Pi to host Matrix for your family,
friends or company.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I try it out?</summary>

Yes! You can test our Conduit instance by opening a Matrix client (<https://app.element.io> or Element Android for
example) and registering on the `conduit.rs` homeserver.

It is hosted on a ODROID HC 2 with 2GB RAM and a SAMSUNG Exynos 5422 CPU, which
was used in the Samsung Galaxy S5. It joined many big rooms, including Matrix
HQ.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the current status?</summary>

Conduit is Beta, meaning you can join and participate in most
Matrix rooms, but not all features are supported, and you might run into bugs
from time to time.

There are still a few important features missing:

- E2EE verification over federation
- Outgoing read receipts, typing, presence over federation
